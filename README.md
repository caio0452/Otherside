Otherside prevents mobs that go through portals from hard despawning for a certain amount of seconds, configurable per mob (the default is 20s). Without the plugin, they would hard despawn instantly after going through if there is a player in the destination dimension that's further away from the mob than the `hard-despawn-range`.

**How to download**
